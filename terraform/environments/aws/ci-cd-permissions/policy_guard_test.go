// Package cicdpermissions_test guards the two halves of the #1705 IAM
// escalation fix against drift between the Terraform modules that actually
// run workload roles and the two policy documents in this directory that are
// supposed to bound them.
//
// policy_boundary.tf defines a permissions boundary that caps every role the
// deploy role creates: a service missing from its WorkloadServiceCeiling
// allow list is invisible at `terraform apply` time (the apply succeeds)
// and only shows up as a runtime AccessDenied the first time a Lambda or
// ECS task calls that service, per the "THE ALLOW LIST IS A CEILING, NOT A
// GRANT" note in that file. policy_iam.tf is the delegation half: it forces
// every role the deploy role creates to carry that boundary and allowlists
// the exact managed-policy ARNs the deploy role may attach, closing the
// escalation named in #1705 where any managed policy in the account
// (AdministratorAccess included) could be attached to any cudly-* role.
//
// These tests re-derive both sides from source so a module change that
// silently widens what a workload role can do, or a boundary/allowlist edit
// that silently narrows what modules need, fails CI instead of surfacing as
// a production 403 or an apply-time AccessDenied.
//
// Two of them (TestDeployPolicyGatesRoleMutationOnBoundary and
// TestDeployPolicyDeniesUnapprovedManagedPolicyAttachment) do not check for
// drift at all: they pin the internal shape of the two statements that do the
// actual work, because every way of reopening #1705 by hand is a single-token
// edit inside one of them (StringEquals -> StringEqualsIfExists,
// ArnNotEquals -> ArnEquals, a "*" added to the ARN allowlist, Deny -> Allow)
// that leaves every drift-based assertion in this file green.
